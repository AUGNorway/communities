In May, the cloud-laden blue skies above Mumbai herald the annual Global Azure Bootcamp.

We are calling on all Azure enthusiasts from Mumbai, and its nearby environs to come and join us, where we share our expertise and experience.

We strive for diversity, inclusiveness, and equity. All are invited to apply, and we strongly  encourage first time speakers and especially, folks identifying themselves as part of an underrepresented minority[URM] in the Mumbai technology ecosystem to apply to our [Call for Papers[CfP]](https://sessionize.com/gab23mum/).

This will be our 5th straight Azure Global Bootcamp; previous editions were held in [2018](https://gab18mum.eventbrite.com/), [2019](https://gab19mum.eventbrite.com/), [2021](https://gab21mum.eventbrite.com/), & [2022](https://gab22mum.eventbrite.com/). We skipped 2020 due to the `COVID pandemic`.
