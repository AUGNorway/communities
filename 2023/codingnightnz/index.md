We're excited to be co-hosting the event at **[Coding Night NZ](https://www.meetup.com/coding-night-nz/)** on May 12th!

We are having a hybrid lunch session on May 12th at Microsoft Auckland, and ad-hoc online sessions on May 13th to talk about Azure!

Expect great sessions covering AI, security, identity, developer technologies, devops and beyond.

This is also a great chance to network with MVPs and experts in the Azure world.

Talks will be delivered to our live audience and streamed on Coding Night NZ YouTube channel.
