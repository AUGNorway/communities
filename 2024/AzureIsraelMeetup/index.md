### Detailed Session Abstracts

#### Mastering Microservices: Unleashing the Power of Dapr in Distributed Systems

**Tal Cohen**
The move towards Microservices Architecture (MSA) has brought to light the complexities involved in developing distributed systems, particularly around communication, state management, and resilience. The Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) offers a crucial solution by simplifying the development of microservices, allowing developers to focus on building scalable, resilient applications without getting bogged down by the underlying complexities. This lecture aims to equip Azure developers with a solid understanding of Dapr, highlighting its design philosophy, key features, and how it enhances the scalability and resilience of microservices.
Dapr's approach prioritizes developer productivity and application robustness. It provides essential services such as state management, service-to-service invocation, event-driven architectures, and bindings to external systems. These capabilities reduce the need for boilerplate code and help developers concentrate on the application's business logic.
Within the Azure ecosystem, Dapr integrates seamlessly with services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Container Apps (ACA), offering flexible hosting options that leverage Azure's infrastructure for improved performance and reliability. This integration facilitates the development of microservices that are scalable, resilient, and portable, addressing key challenges in distributed application development and supporting multi-cloud strategies.
This lecture will explore practical Azure use cases to demonstrate how Dapr addresses the challenges of MSA, guiding attendees on using Dapr to build advanced microservices on Azure. Designed for Azure developers, this session provides insights into navigating MSA complexities effectively, utilizing Dapr for enhanced application performance and resilience.

#### Orchestrating Resilience: A Saga of Distributed Systems on Azure

**Alon Fliess**
One of the main difficulties when crafting a Micro service distributed system, is how to manage distributed state and ensure consistency across services. Our session at the Azure Global Day event will help you overcome these difficulties, showing you the importance of the Saga pattern for achieving reliable and consistent operation in distributed systems.  We'll start with a clear explanation of the challenges of managing distributed states and the essential need for effective rollback and compensation mechanisms. You'll see how the Saga pattern can help you coordinate transactions across distributed services and guarantee system-wide consistency without wasting resources.  We'll go further as we show you the Dapr Actor model, a key tool for developers who want to build scalable, resilient distributed applications. We'll show you how Dapr Actors provide a solid framework for state management and message processing, forming a vital component for hosting the Saga pattern implementation.  As we deal with the challenges of Saga orchestration, we present Dapr Workflow as a foundation for manual implementing Sagas. We will quickly move to the Sagaway framework, which makes Saga implementation easier and more approachable for developers. You'll learn how Sagaway, together with Dapr's features, simplifies the creation and execution of Sagas, offering a more user-friendly way to manage distributed transactions.  Join this session at the Azure Global Day event, where you'll discover how to apply the Dapr Actor model and the Sagaway framework to excel at creating consistent, resilient distributed applications. If you're a developer or architect, this session will equip you with the understanding and tools to deal with the challenges of modern distributed application development.
