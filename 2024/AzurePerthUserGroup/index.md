# Perth Azure User Group - Global Azure 2024
 
We're back again this year for a day of Azure learning.

Global Azure is from the community, for the community. 

During this global event, communities worldwide will be organising local editions, like this one for Perth.

Planning for the day is still underway, and our schedule will be updated as we go. 

We will be running the event on Saturday April 20 and lunch will be provided.

More details will follow via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/perthazug/).

If you have any questions, feedback or thoughts, please get in touch with the community [leadership team](https://www.meetup.com/perthazug/members/?op=leaders).
