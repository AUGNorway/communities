Welcome to the second Global Azure (Bootcamp) 2024 in Skopje, Macedonia.

We are excited to announce that two Microsoft focused communities, Macedonian .Net Community and Macedonian IT Pro User Group joined forces to organize this community event in Skopje.

Global Azure is from the community, for the community. During this global event, communities worldwide will be organizing local editions, and on the 20th of April 2024 it will be organized for the second time in Skopje, Macedonia.

Planning for the schedule and agenda is still underway, and will be announced and updated as we go. We are considering a day event covering a broad range of Azure topics.

At the moment there is Call for Speakers opened for this local event, and all interested experts can apply on the following [link](https://sessionize.com/global-azure-north-macedonia-2024/).
