# Welcome to OCD Huddles | Azure Edition

## 🍁 What is Huddles?

​​​Huddles is a meetup organized by OCD India, which aims to create awareness about specific technologies that benefit early-stage developers, working professionals, and developing teams. We aim to create an environment where participants can engage in meaningful discussions, learn from industry leaders, and expand their network.

## 💡 What is Global Azure?

​​Global Azure is an annual, once-in-a-year community initiative, and via Huddles, we’re bringing this initiative to our local community. We want technologists in and around our region to receive the opportunity to learn from the best in the community and in the industry.

## ​💻 What can you expect from this meetup?

​This meetup is designed explicitly for students and working professionals eager to learn about Azure technologies and OpenAI and how they can benefit from them. We have lined up an impressive panel of speakers who are experts in these fields and are ready to share their knowledge and insights with you.

​By attending this session, you will gain valuable insights into these technologies and how they are changing the face of software development. You will also have the opportunity to connect with other like-minded individuals and expand your professional network.
