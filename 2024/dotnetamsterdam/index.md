Save yourself and your users time with Microsoft Entra External ID authentication. Microsoft Entra External ID provides built-in support for multiple identity providers, such as Google and Apple ID. With just a few clicks in Azure, and a few lines of code in your app, your users can sign in, sign out and a lot of other useful things. You donâ€™t even have to worry about creating a login page!
 
In this session, you will learn the basics of Entra External ID, its benefits, and how to integrate it into your app and Azure. This includes a walkthrough on setting up Entra External ID and a demonstration of how you can log in with a .NET MAUI app and access an API.

You may be interested in creating agents with the Microsoft Semantic Kernel using GPT Assistants for handling complex problem-solving tasks. It uses AI to coordinate the work among multiple assistants. Each assistant has its own persona and tools, operating as separate GPTs. The days of manually managing conversation states and chat threads are behind us. Now, with the support of these assistants, we can have conversations that remember their context. 

In the next talk I explore how these assistants can interact in three different scenarios: 
- hierarchical chat agents (interactive chat) 
- joint chat agents (interactive chat) 
- agent powered by agents as plugins chat (one prompt chat) 

For this, I have created four agents, each representing a different hero: Jack Sparrow, Don Quijote, Shakespeare, and Yoda. Additionally, I have a dialogue writer agent that takes a dialogue script and brings these heroes to life. Well, let's see what happens when Jack Sparrow is messing up with Don Quijote!

Developers often find themselves building APIs solely for data retrieval and storage, a task that can lack excitement and be very time-consuming. Enter Microsoft's open-source solution: Data API Builder. This tool enables you to securely expose your Azure database through REST and GraphQL endpoints, eliminating the need to manually write these APIs.

Join this session to explore the features, deployment options, and nuances of Data API Builder. We'll also showcase its seamless integration with Azure Static Web Apps.
